If you want to do other stuff relating to MGC, you can look into MGC-X. It identifies similarities using time series.
In other words, it takes different functions with random curves, and superposes them. Then, you set the starting point
of the other functions to set the best match with the first function.

For example: (function 1)
  /
 /
/

(function 2 - starts at time 1, which is the reason of the additional space at bottom)
     /
  --/
 /

Now superpose both gives us something like this:
  /  /
 /--/
//

The best match would be by having a time lag of -1 on the second function, so both functions' starting points can overlap.

OTHER NOTES
Remember MGC is an advancement on the simple distance correlation function (dcorr), which we take the distance between
the points to determine if there is a relation. dcorr cannot see when there are 2D relationships, like a spiral relationship.
