(Note: It was supposed to give something like this, since my data was totally random)
This above means that my data is too much different (a 67.3% difference
overall between them) so there is no pattern that can be determined.
Also, the value of MGC is very close to 0, which suggests that there is no
relation. A value of 0.2, however, might suggest a relationship.
