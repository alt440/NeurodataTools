So this graph is principally divided in 4 sections: K, P, I, O. As the slides 
of their work outlines, these are the four types of neurons. I could not find
it through wikipedia this way, but here are the actual names of the neurons:
-Kenyon cell (K)
-Mushroom body input neuron (I) --> believe this is specific to mushroom, but
there are some for other living entities.
-Output neuron (O)
-Mushroom body projection neuron (P) --> same idea as description for I above

The graph is giving us the probability a connection we choose is connection X
and X neuron.
For example, all the red spots in the K,K zone of the graph outlines the high
probability that a randomly chosen connection connects a K neuron to another K
neuron (or Kenyon cell).
Same principle applies for the other categories. If you look under I column 
intersecting with the O row, then the number of red points show the 
probability that there is a connection from I to O neuron.
